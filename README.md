# geopulse

This project builds a real-time system that extracts, geotags, and visualizes real-world events from news articles and social media (Twitter/X). Events include conflict, climate, health, infrastructure, crime, and cultural updates. The final output is a structured JSON feed that can be displayed on a map-based dashboard.
